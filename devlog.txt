Things that arent working: 

Practice Mode: The list of chords and scales is not showing up in the dropdown for each mode. For example theres no option to choose sus4, maj7, etc. Need to search the codebase to see if those are still present or have been removed.

Soundfond Library not loading. 

Fix these things first, then move on to developing the YouTube integration and interface. 

Made lots of improvements to the interface. Fix the practice mode panel so that it only says "Chord Mode" and "Scale Mode" upon opening.

Trying to get the practice logs to save across sessions. Last fix seems to have worked in terms of more practice logs being saved, but now the practice mode itself is all screwy.

Fixed the practice mode. Now plays one at a time. Developing the chord progression detector. have a large dataset of songs with very detailed chord progressions in the train_chord_detector.py. Need to verify that the keys 
and progressions are correct. Do this manually or by inputing the chords and progressions into other llms to verify. Then integrate it with the back end and the UI.

The Work flow of entering a youtube link, getting chords, and having them played back on the piano is set up. Now it needs to be Massively improved both in function and Aesthetic, but its there.
